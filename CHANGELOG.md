# Changelog

## 3.0.0 (2014-09-16)

New package version "3.0.0" includes the following features:

- New `node_roles.yaml` file that allows to add new node roles.
- New `volumes.yaml` file that allows to add new volumes and/or define
  "node roles <-> volumes" mapping.
- New `deployment_tasks.yaml` file that allows to declare pre/post- and
  regular deployment tasks for any node role. Unlike `tasks.yaml`, the
  tasks go through global deployment graph and that provides ability
  to execute task at any place during deployment, or overwrite/skip
  already existing ones.
- New `network_roles.yaml` file that allows to add new network roles
  and reserve some VIPs, to be proceed by plugin.
