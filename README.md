Fuel Plugins
============
Starting with version 6.0, Fuel supports a Pluggable architecture.

Fuel plugins allow you to install and configure additional capabilities for
your cloud, such as additional storage types and networking functionality.
For example, a Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS) plugin allows you to add
network load balancing functionality to your cloud so that incoming traffic
can be spread across multiple nodes.  Or you might want to use a GlusterFS
plugin so that you can use a Gluster file system as backend for Cinder
volumes.

Creating your own plugins
-------------------------
Detailed instructions can be found in the [ Plugins ](http://wiki.openstack.org/Fuel/Plugins "Plugins") wiki page.


Plugins should be built using the
**[fuel_plugin_builder](fuel_plugin_builder)** (fpb) utility found in this
repoistory or via pip. fbp will ensure that build steps as well as validation
is performed prior to assembling a package.

Abbreviated instructions:

```bash
pip install fuel-plugin-builder
fpb --create fuel_plugin_name
fpb --build <path to plugin>
```

This will:
* install fuel_plugin_builder
* clone the fuel_plugin_example plugin with the name fuel_plugin_name
* build the plugin .rpm package.
